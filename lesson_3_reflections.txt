Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having
Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

* What is published on GitHub is publicly available and you do not want to publish on what you are just working on.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.
When would you use one instead of another?

* branch: happens only locally

* fork: happens only on GitHub, y
* you copy something from GitHub into your own account an work on it, without interring with the original creater of th project.

* clone: gets GitHub projects onto your local computer

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?

* git can immediately decide what state the remote was in at the last pull/push and give advice to push

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub?
What would be easier, and what would be harder?

* You would have to publish your code in a public directory and ask for comments/approval.
* Finally someone would have to manually replace the improved file in the production code.

+ You wouldn't need to learn git.
- It's a lot more effort to do it manually.
