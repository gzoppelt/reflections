Why do you need to do it?

* It creates a subdirectory .git where my commits will bie sored and all the versions will be managed.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository?
What value do you think it offers?

* Files from the working directory are chosen for a commit by adding then to the staging area.
* The user has control what is going to be in the next commit.
