How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more efficient progrsmmer int the long term?

When something breaks I can easily switch to a former working version.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions ayutomatically saved, like Google docs does?

+ logical steps, documentation
- when lazy and gaps too large you might loose a lot when something awful happens

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file seperately?

* Because in programing the files are interconnected.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to vies the history of files?

* uses less, up and down, h for help q for quit.

Now that you have your workspace setup, what do you want to try using Git for?

* program backup
* version control
* switch between devices while developing
